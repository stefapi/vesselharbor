# Implementation Notes: Commit Message Validation

## Changes Made

1. Created a Python script for commit message validation:
   - Added `scripts/validate_commit_msg.py` that implements the Conventional Commits rules
   - Made the script executable

2. Set up Git hooks:
   - Created a `.husky` directory
   - Added a `commit-msg` hook that runs the Python validation script
   - Created a setup script `scripts/setup_git_hooks.sh` to configure Git to use our hooks

3. Updated documentation:
   - Modified `COMMIT_CONVENTION.md` to reflect the new setup
   - Updated `README.md` to include information about commit message validation

## Setup

To enable commit message validation, run the setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup_git_hooks.sh
```

This script configures Git to use our hooks directory, which contains the commit-msg hook that validates commit messages.

## How to Test

### Using the Test Scripts

Two test scripts are provided to verify that the validation works correctly:

1. Test the validation logic directly:
```bash
./scripts/test_commit_validation.py
```
This script tests the validation with various valid and invalid commit messages and reports the results.

2. Test the Git hook integration:
```bash
./scripts/test_git_hook.sh
```
This script simulates what happens during a git commit to verify that the hook correctly calls the validation script.

### Manual Testing

1. Try making a commit with an invalid message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "invalid commit message"
   ```
   This should be rejected with an error message.

2. Try making a commit with a valid message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add commit message validation"
   ```
   This should be accepted.

## Validation Rules

The commit messages are validated against the rules implemented in `scripts/validate_commit_msg.py`, which follows the Conventional Commits specification. The main requirements are:

- The commit message must start with a type (e.g., feat, fix, docs)
- The type must be followed by a colon and a space
- The subject must not be empty
- The subject must not end with a period
- The subject must use the imperative, present tense

For more details, see the [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) file.
